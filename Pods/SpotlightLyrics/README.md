## How to use
* Download or clone the repository to your local
* Copy `SpotlightLyrics.framework` from frameworks folder to the your project
* Open your project in XCode and navigate to `General` - `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` to add the component into you project

To import the `SpotlightLyrics`, just import the `SpotlightLyrics`  library in your code as usual.
```Swift
import SpotlightLyrics
```

To parse the LRC file only, just use `LyricsParser` class, do the following
```Swift
import SpotlightLyrics

... Load the lyrics string from local or remote

let parser = LyricsParser(lyrics: lyricsString)
print(parser.header.title)
print(parser.header.author)
print(parser.header.album)

print(parser.lyrics[0].lyrics)
print(parser.lyrics[0].time)
```

To display the lyrics in your view or controller, do the following
```Swift
import SpotlightLyrics

... Load the lyrics string from local or remote

let lyricsView = LyricsView()
lyricsView.frame = self.view.bounds
self.view.addSubView(lyricsView)

lyricsView.lyrics = lyricsString
lyricsView.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 13)
lyricsView.textColor = UIColor.black

// Scroll to the TimeInterval you want to highlight
lyricsView.scroll(to: 20, animated: true)
```

Also you can still add the `LyaricsView` by operating `XIB` files.
